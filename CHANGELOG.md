# Changelog

## 0.0.1-beta.4

Beta 4 focuses on making long agent sessions easier to run, inspect, and recover: better context/quota visibility, safer file and shell behavior, more Claude Code-compatible tools, and release-ready TUI polish.

### Highlights

- Added daemon-free code intelligence with the `lsp` tool: document/workspace symbols, go-to-definition, references, and hover for Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Go.
- Added isolated git worktrees through `enter_worktree`/`exit_worktree` plus `/worktree create [name]` and `/worktree exit keep|remove [--discard]` in the TUI.
- Added `/usage` for live provider quota/rate-limit status, separate from `/cost`'s local token tally and USD estimate.
- Added `/context` (`/ctx`) to show real context-window usage plus a rough breakdown of where the visible conversation is spending tokens.
- Added `tool_search` for progressive MCP tool disclosure when many MCP tools are connected, reducing per-request schema bloat.

### New tools and commands

- Added `wait`, a non-blocking 1–120s sleep for poll-and-wait loops that does not occupy a foreground shell slot.
- Added task dependencies to `todo_write` with `id` and `blockedBy`, including unblocked-task summaries and dimmed blocked items in the live todo panel.
- Added stale-file guards to `edit_file`, `multi_edit`, and `write_file` so writes are refused when the file changed after the model last read it.
- Added `/commit` and `/commit-push-pr` slash commands with a git safety protocol, Conventional Commit generation, optional branch push, and PR creation via `gh`.
- Added `opencli run` as an alias for headless `chat`, plus `--cwd` and `--prompt-file` for cron/systemd-style scheduled runs.

### Reliability and recovery

- Hardened OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic streaming against early SSE connection drops. Pre-output drops retry the turn; drops after usable text or a completed tool call finalize the streamed work, while incomplete tool calls are skipped instead of executing partial arguments.
- Captured provider quota from response headers and Codex `codex.rate_limits` events without extra API calls, covering ChatGPT/Codex OAuth, OpenAI API keys, Claude OAuth, and Anthropic API keys.
- Increased `dispatch_agent`'s outer hard timeout independently of ordinary tools, so long repo-audit subagents are not cut off by the default per-tool cap.
- Kept deferred MCP tools available after working-directory changes mid-session.

### Safety and security

- Hardened `dispatch_agent` cwd overrides: child cwd values are canonicalized and must stay under the parent session cwd.
- Hardened `run_shell` destructive-command detection for absolute program paths such as `/bin/rm`, `/usr/bin/git`, `/sbin/mkfs.*`, and `/usr/bin/curl | /bin/sh`.
- Wrote `config.json` with owner-only permissions on Unix and redacted provider API keys from `config --show`.
- Preserved sub-agent approval safety: when nested approvals cannot be surfaced, sub-agents run in enforced plan mode rather than silently bypassing review.

### TUI polish and fixes

- Improved `run_shell` rendering to match Claude Code more closely: red stderr, no separator box, compact `Error (exit N)` footer, and more failed-command output kept inline.
- Fixed long-session TUI garbling by sanitizing ANSI codes, tabs, and carriage returns before rendering tool output.
- Fixed a plan-approval lockout where typing a follow-up while the agent was planning could make `Y` stop approving the plan.
- Updated README and in-app slash command discovery for the beta4 release line and `/usage`.

## 0.0.1-beta.3

Stability beta adding proactive context management and hardening streamed tool calls, reasoning portability, and `/goal` limits.

- Added proactive context "microcompaction": when the last request crosses ~75% of the context window, stale already-seen tool-output bulk is shed before the next request (keeping every message and reasoning block intact) — far cheaper and less lossy than a full `/compact`. Scoped to the history the model has already been shown, so a large parallel tool batch's fresh results are never dropped before it reads them.
- Added automatic recovery from a hard context-window overflow: shed stale tool outputs and retry the turn (bounded) instead of failing, covering both a pre-stream rejection and an overflow surfaced as an error mid-stream.
- Tracked context occupancy from provider-reported usage and stopped a failed or usage-less response from zeroing it (which had silently disabled proactive microcompaction on the next turn).
- Fixed streamed tool-call arguments dropping a bare `null`/`{}`/`[]` value mid-object (e.g. a streamed `"limit": null`), which corrupted the accumulated JSON; the leading empty-args placeholder rule now lives in one shared helper across the OpenAI Responses, Chat Completions, and Anthropic paths so they can't drift.
- Added the `forward_reasoning_effort` provider option to forward reasoning effort to OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints (off by default; `minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high` pass through, `xhigh`/`max`/`ultracode` clamp to `high`, unknown levels omitted to avoid 400s).
- Dropped provider-foreign reasoning/thinking items before the OpenAI Responses wire, so a `/model` switch or a resumed cross-provider session no longer 400s on a foreign reasoning id.
- Added `OPENCLI_DEBUG_WIRE=1` opt-in wire diagnostics to confirm the reasoning effort and token usage actually sent to the provider.
- Bounded `/goal` objectives by both word and character count, so an overlong objective — including space-free CJK text — can't crowd out the real work on every continuation turn.
- Returned a clear "file not found" error from `read_file` instead of leaking the underlying `stat` syscall name.

## 0.0.1-beta.2

Stability beta focused on tool-call compatibility, goal recovery, and credential/model correctness.

- Fixed OpenAI strict tool schemas so `dispatch_agent` and optional tool fields satisfy required/nullable schema rules.
- Hardened OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic stream parsing across text, reasoning, and tool-call delta aliases.
- Limited ChatGPT/Codex OAuth model catalogues to verified OAuth-backed models while keeping full OpenAI catalogues for API-key mode.
- Added credential coverage reporting for OpenAI OAuth/API key and Anthropic OAuth/API key without exposing secrets.
- Preserved OAuth credentials when saving API keys, so multiple credential types can coexist and active mode can switch cleanly.
- Normalized `provider/model` config inputs consistently across config, chat, and TUI slash commands.
- Paused active `/goal` runs on provider/tool errors instead of silently continuing from a broken turn.
- Kept JSON chat output clean by suppressing stderr tracing in `json` and `stream-json` modes.
- Added local release packaging/smoke scripts, CI smoke coverage, and release artifact checksums for repeatable beta verification.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

Initial beta release candidate.
